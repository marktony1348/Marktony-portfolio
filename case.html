      <h1>Case Study for <span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> full-stack project</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <div class="intro-content">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p><span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> is a web application that gives users access to details on movies, directors, 
            and genres. It was created using the MERN stack. Users have the option to register, edit their personal information, 
            and compile a list of their favourite films.</p>
          <br />
          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
          <p><span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> was a side project I created for CareerFoundry's web development course in Berlin, Germany, 
            to show off my proficiency with full-stack web programming utilizing frameworks like React and 
            Angular.JS</p>
          <br />
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>The project's goal was to construct the application's server-side and client-side components entirely from scratch.</p>
          <h2>Tools</h2>
          <p>The following tools were used to create the application: <br>
            • Html <br>
            • Scss <br>
            • Javascript <br>
            • Postman  <br>
            • Angular.Js <br>
            • MongoDb</p>

      <h2 class="approach-title">Methodology/Implementation</h2>
      <div class="server-side">
        <div class="server-content">
          <h3>Server-Side creation</h3>
          <p>Using Node.js and Express, I developed a Restful API that communicates with a non-relational 
            database (MongoDB). I also used well known HTTP methods such as GET or POST to access the API.
            Finally I employed the CRUD techniques to obtain and save data in the database. The API then 
            returns a JSON-formatted movie information when called upon.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>Also i used Postman to check that the API was functioning properly and in addition, I added JWT and
            elementary HTTP authentication for user identification and authorization codes.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="client-side">
        <div class="client-content">
          <h3>Client-Side creation</h3>
          <p>After finishing the API, I began to create the user interface that users would use to send requests to 
            and get results from the server-side. It was created using React and React-Redux and is a singlepage, responsive application. It offers a number of interface views, including, but not limited to, a 
            main view (displays a list of all movies), single movie view (displays information about a single film 
            and enables users to add the film to their list of favourites), login view, registration view, and profile 
            view (where users can update their user data and list of favourites).</p>

      <div class="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I particularly found Angular framework interesting. Despite that the fact that its development process
          was a bit arduous. This is because i noticed some differences in the syntax as ascribed to the 
          TypeScript language of the Angular framework in comparison to the regular JavaScript syntax. To 
          also tackle this disparity I had to utilize some documentation and also look at some YouTube 
          tutorials which were recommended by my mentor and also my tutor. This step actually helped me a 
          great deal to resolving the syntax issues.
          The installation of the software was another intriguing and difficult aspect of the project, requiring 
          constant documentation checks to make sure the correct versions were correctly installed. I 
          occasionally get problems, but I typically am able to address them on my own by conducting my own
          investigations and debugging. But in situations where these procedures failed, my tutor and mentor 
          always made the difference by using peer programming to assist me resolve the issues and adhere 
          to the project deadline</p>

      <div class="duration">
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>The development of the client-side was particularly challenging. It took me a month to accomplish 
          the objectives. Eventually, after some break and a restudy of the React documentation, a better 
          understanding was achieved as to the functionalities of React, React-redux, Angular and also the use
          of typescript</p>
