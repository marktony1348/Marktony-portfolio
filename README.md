# Portfolio Website

A responsive one-pager that prioritizes mobile design and serves as a display for my professional portfolio. To toggle the hamburger menu on mobile displays and enable the Read more and Read less buttons, it is developed using only HTML, CSS, and a few lines of Javascript. For repeating values, native variables are used in the CSS code. The browser support was enhanced using a postprocessor.
